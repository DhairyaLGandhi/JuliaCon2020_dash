# 1. Why would that be useful?
# To producionize or produtize a trained model to be used by a larger
# number of people without needing to how it works.

# 2. How would I make a local server
# Dashboards.jl is easy to use to understand and easy to demonstrate
# A scaled up system would use a more traditional webserver behind a
# proxy such as nginx. This can be done using Mux.jl. This is a demostration
# of the concept and workflow.

# 3. How does Dashboards.jl work
# This is a Julia port of Dash which is a very popular framework developed by the
# plotly team. It is used to create web apps without needing any Javascript experience.

# 4. What we will do?
# We will train a neural network with Flux, and have a user defined file loaded and inferred
# through Dashboards.jl

# Let's Get Started
# We will start with defining our neural network. For the purposes of the micro training, we
# will keep this fairly easy and have a simple CNN that we will use to learn the MNIST dataset.
# The network itself can be stored from where you will serve the app. It can be a docker container,
# for example and we will use the BSON scheme to store our network and the trained weights.

# For the demo, we will train our model, but in production we only need to worry about
# the saved model and its pretrained weights, not the actual logic of what the ML
# pipeline is doing. They are completely separated, to make sure it is easy to separate
# how the different aspects of the entire pipeline are structured.
# include("train.jl")

# We load the mode, its pretrained weights, and make sure eveything is set up to be run.
@load "model_conv.bson" model

ps = BSON.load("mnist_conv2.bson")[:params]
Flux.loadparams!(model, ps)

# We now have a trained model!

# We will use the Foundation CSS library for this training. But it can be your favourite CSS stylesheet
stylesheets = ["https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/foundation-sites@6.4.3/dist/css/foundation-float.min.css",

         "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/foundation-sites@6.4.3/dist/css/foundation-rtl.min.css"]

# As you can see, we have a bunch of CSS files that we can simply reuse in our app.
# To define the app, we create a `Dash` object. The API is very similar to how the python version of
# plotly behaves, with some helpful sugar mixed in to make the whole process smoother.

# Note that the argument is the title of the app. This is displayed in the title bar.
# It additionally accepts many other keyword arguments. Here we give Dashboards the CSS we had chosen earlier
# and the folder from which it will pick up assets from.

# The body of the do-block holds in the base skeleton of what our app is supposed to do.
# Notice how we create `h1` and `divs` similar to how you would expect them to be in HTML.

  # and our input `img` with `Flux.gpu` if we have GPUs available on the machine to get better
  # performance. We don't need any extra configuration.

  # Through `model(img)`, we have the values of the probabilities of the image being a number between
  # 0 and 9. Now we want to display it as a bar graph. We use plotly to do our analytical plotting.
  # The dcc_graph function allows us to simply set the values on the x-axis being 0-9 and y-axis as
